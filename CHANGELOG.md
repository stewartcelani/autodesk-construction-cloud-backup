# Changelog

## Version 1.1.0 (2025-01-08)

### Major Features

- **Incremental Backup**: Dramatically reduces backup time by copying unchanged files from previous backup instead of
  re-downloading
    - 95% faster backups for mostly unchanged data (12 hours â†’ 30 minutes for 250GB)
    - Automatic file integrity verification
    - Fallback to download if local copy fails verification
    - BackupManifest.json tracking for reliable change detection

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed critical bug where `--backupstorotate 1` prevented incremental backup from working** - The rotation logic now
  correctly interprets this parameter as the number of previous backups to keep (in addition to current), ensuring at
  least one previous backup is always available for incremental comparison
- Fixed backup rotation timing - now rotates after backup completion instead of before
- Fixed issue where backup tool could attempt to delete its own directory during rotation
- Improved path handling for cross-platform compatibility
- Enhanced robustness for special characters in project names
- Improved error handling in manifest loading with specific exception types for better debugging

### Improvements

- Upgraded to .NET 9 for improved performance and latest runtime features
- Migrated from NLog to Serilog for improved logging capabilities and performance
- Added `--force-full-download` flag to bypass incremental backup when needed
- Better logging with incremental backup statistics
- Estimated time saved reporting
- Case-insensitive manifest lookups for cross-platform compatibility

### Technical Details

- Files are considered unchanged when FileId, VersionNumber, LastModifiedTime, and StorageSize all match
- Manifest uses normalized paths with forward slashes for consistency
- Project names are sanitized to handle special characters safely

## Version 1.0.4 (Previous Release)

- Updated to .NET 8 (Note: v1.1.0 now uses .NET 9)
