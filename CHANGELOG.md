# Changelog

## Version 1.1.0 (2025-01-08)

### Major Features
- **Incremental Backup**: Dramatically reduces backup time by copying unchanged files from previous backup instead of re-downloading
  - 95% faster backups for mostly unchanged data (12 hours â†’ 30 minutes for 250GB)
  - Automatic file integrity verification
  - Fallback to download if local copy fails verification
  - BackupManifest.json tracking for reliable change detection

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed backup rotation timing - now rotates after backup completion instead of before
- Fixed issue where backup tool could attempt to delete its own directory during rotation
- Improved path handling for cross-platform compatibility
- Enhanced robustness for special characters in project names

### Improvements
- Added `--force-full-download` flag to bypass incremental backup when needed
- Better logging with incremental backup statistics
- Estimated time saved reporting
- Case-insensitive manifest lookups for cross-platform compatibility

### Technical Details
- Files are considered unchanged when FileId, VersionNumber, LastModifiedTime, and StorageSize all match
- Manifest uses normalized paths with forward slashes for consistency
- Project names are sanitized to handle special characters safely
